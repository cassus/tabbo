### Tab Management Hotkeys

TODO:
- Create issues pages for each of the bullets
- Make extension work for both hotkeys and mouse
- Tabs:

Move tab between open windows
Pop tab off to send to a new window
Move tab within window
Shift tab left and right (when reaching the end it will pop off)
Move multiple tabs at once (think long and hard about this one)

- Windows:
Think about the new window positions
Control window positions

- Keybinds: 
Have options to set keybinds
Show keybinds whenver possible
not too much window management

- Extras:
Have advanced mode where keybinds and extra HUDs don't show up
Show snapshots of what the windows look like
Have window screenshots appear
REACT EVERYTHING!
